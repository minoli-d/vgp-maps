The assembly process included the following sequence of steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, retained haplotig separation with purge_dups, and Hi-C based scaffolding with YaHS. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi. Finally, the primary assembly was analysed and manually improved using rapid curation.
