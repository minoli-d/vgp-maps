There are six subspecies of barn swallow, which breed across the Northern Hemisphere. Four are strongly migratory, and their wintering grounds cover much of the Southern Hemisphere as far south as central Argentina, the Cape Province of South Africa, and northern Australia. Its huge range means that the barn swallow is not endangered, although there may be local population declines due to specific threats. The barn swallow is a bird of open country that normally uses man-made structures to breed and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup nest from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight. This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by humans; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration.

Background:
The red-winged blackbird (family Icteridae), one of the most common songbirds in North America and an icterid with typical nesting behavior, was chosen for this study to serve as an outgroup to the obligate brood parasitic brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Red-winged blackbird DNA isolated for whole genome sequencing is derived from an adult female located in the state of Texas. High molecular weight DNA was used as input to generate long-reads using circular consensus sequence (CCS) base calling output from the Sequel II instrument (Pacific Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total CCS coverage was approx. 38x using a genome size estimate of 1.1Gb. All quality filtered sequence reads were assembled with HiFasm using default parameter settings and redundant contigs removed using purge_haplotigs. Assembled contigs were scaffolded with Hi-C data from the same individual using SALSA2, and then manually curated with JuiceBox. Chromosomes were numbered by size with the exception of 16 which was numbered based on alignment with chicken.

This work was supported by NSF grants DBI 1754311, 1754397, 1754406, 1754643, 1940624.

With likely fewer than 100 individuals remaining, Rice's whales are one of the most endangered whales in the world. Recovery of the species depends upon the protection of each remaining whale. The Rice's whale has been consistently located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, along the continental shelf break between 100 and about 400 meters depth. They are the only resident baleen whale in the Gulf of Mexico and are most closely related to Bryde's (pronounced ""broodus"") whales. In 2021, scientists determined that the Rice's whale was a unique species, genetically and morphologically distinct from Bryde's whales. This sample was collected from a beach-stranded calf in 2006 and frozen in the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (NIST), originally identified as Bryde's whale, then re-classified as Rice's whale based on genetic analysis and geographic location after the Rice's whale species was described.

Cephalochordata is divided into three genera (Asymmetron, Epigonichthys, and Branchiostoma) encompassing at least 35 species. Currently considered the most basal group within the chordate lineage, the amphioxus Branchiostoma lanceolatum shares several key characteristics with vertebrates. These include a dorsal nerve cord, notochord, segmental muscles, perforated pharynx with gill slit, a post anal tail, and homolog of the pronephric kidney, and vertebrate adenohypophysis and thyroid gland. Amphioxus is widely distributed in sandy habitats of tropical and temperate seas, where it spends most of its lives buried in the sea floor. The embryonic and larval stages of amphioxus are planktonic, while the adults are benthic. Amphioxus is gonochoristic with distinct male and female animals, and the spawning season varies between species. Adult amphioxus with mature gonads can be artificially induced to spawn in the laboratory to achieve in vitro fertilization. Morphological distinctions among adults from various amphioxus species can be made by evaluating general body symmetry. Additionally, comparisons of the total count of muscle segments, dorsal and anal fin chambers, and pharyngeal slits serve as distinguishing factors. Over the last decades, amphioxus has emerged as a valuable model organism for developmental and evolutionary studies, and comparative genomics. Molecular and genomic studies have highlighted that amphioxus genome closely mirrors that of vertebrates, exhibiting similarity in both gene family content and genomic linkage. However, a crucial distinction lies in the fact that the amphioxus genome has not undergone the two rounds of whole-genome duplication commonly observed in vertebrate genomes. Therefore, the morphological and genomic simplicity of cephalochordates, in comparison to vertebrates, makes amphioxus an attractive model for studying chordate biology and gaining insights into the origin and evolution of vertebrates.",NA,44.4137,8.9289,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,6,NA,"sampling"

Like most sea turtles, Loggerheads are highly migratory and use a great variety of localities and habitats during their lifetimes. The population status of the Loggerhead turtle has been assessed for the IUCN Red List of threatened species and is globally listed as Vulnerable (Sources: NOAA Fisheries https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/loggerhead-turtle; IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group https://www.iucn-mtsg.org/updates/2015-loggerhead-redlist-assessments).

Males of this species form long-term cooperative alliances and display together to attract females, but only the dominant alpha member of each pair usually mates. Subordinate beta males participate closely in displays, but benefit through increased chances of becoming an alpha in future years. Males compete for alpha positions, and after male status is established, females make mate choices by flying among dispersed alpha display territories. Displays are acrobatic and complex. Their song repertoire is diverse for a suboscine and includes male-male duets by alpha-beta partners. Adults can live up to 18 years. Females raise chicks outside of mates display areas and without male assistance, and tracking via video and telemetry has been used to recreate the process of mate choice and test hypotheses about how and why females choose the mates they do. Archived samples from one population monitored for 20+ years are available for questions requiring known relationships among individuals, and longitudinal data on individual genetic reproductive success. This sample of an adult female from Isla Boca Brava, Republic of Panama, was collected by Emily DuVal following an incidental netting death.

Gray whales earned the nickname 'devil fish' because of their aggressive reactions when harpooned. Commercial whaling rapidly brought both Pacific populations to near extinction. International conservation measures were enacted in the 1930s and 1940s to protect whales from over-exploitation, and in the mid-1980s the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling. Gray whales are known for their curiosity toward boats in some locations and are the focus of whale watching and ecotourism along the west coast of North America. Gray whales make one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal, traveling about 10,000 miles round-trip and in some cases upwards of 14,000 miles.

Two other right whale species exist: the North Pacific right whale, found in the North Pacific Ocean; and the southern right whale, found in the southern hemisphere. Right whales are baleen whales, feeding on copepods (tiny crustaceans) by straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates, which act like a sieve. By the early 1890s, commercial whalers had hunted North Atlantic right whales to the brink of extinction. They got their name from being the ""right"" whales to hunt because they floated when they were killed. Whaling is no longer a threat, but they have never recovered to pre-whaling numbers, and human interactions still present the greatest danger. Entanglements in fishing gear and vessel strikes are the leading causes of North Atlantic right whale mortality. Increasing ocean noise levels from human activities are also a concern since the noise may interfere with right whale communication and increase their stress levels (NOAA website).

This alternate haplotype assembly combines the haplotigs separated by purge_dups with haplotigs separated from the primary assembly during curation.",NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,"results/species/Thunnus_thynnus/range_raster.tif","results/species/Thunnus_thynnus/range_raster_goode.tif",-35.3734545759367,28.8416688739471,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,7,"Manual centroid (sampling loc invalid)","centroid"
